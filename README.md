Read through 'Process Overview' in this repository for an outline of processing.  This processing utilizes CLC Genomics Workbench, QIIME, R, and general Python 2.7 scripts to process sequences from Illumina MiSeq metabarcoding data.  Each step can be modified based on parameters of the study or preference for processing (i.e. trimomatic instead of CLC Genomics Workbench for quality filtering). Any questions on the process can be directed to hoenigb@duq.edu or brandonhoenig@gmail.com
