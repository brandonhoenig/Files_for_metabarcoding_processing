#In QIIME:
#Summarize the Final OTU Table into text files for manipulation in Excel, R, or Matplotlib

#Use this python script to create plots and .txt files and deposit them into a folder:
summarize_taxa_through_plots.py -i Filtered_OTUTable.biom -o summarized_taxa

#This creates .txt files that end in 'L2' (Class-Level Assignment), 'L3' (Order-Level Assignment), 
  #'L4' (Family-Level Assignment), 'L5' (Genus-Level Assignment), & 'L6' (Species-Level Assignment).
  
#When opened in Excel, rows are Taxonomic assignment and columns are SampleID as assigned in the SampleMappingFile.txt

#Numbers in each cell are a percentage of sequences assigned to that taxonomy for each sample. 
#The raw number of sequences for each cell can be calculated by multiplying the number in the cell by the corresponding 
#number of sequences for each sample found in the output from:
biom summarize-table -i Filtered_OTUTable.biom -o Summarized_Filtered_OTUTable.txt

#Data can now be analyzed and manipulated in Excel, R, or Matplotlib
